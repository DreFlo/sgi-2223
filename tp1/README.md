### Project Information

- Strong points
  - We implemented all of the required functionalities and can interpret scene files from various other groups.
  - Our parser has good error reporting and runs a check for cycles in the scene graph. 
  - Our primitives don't repeat points in the same geometric coordinates unless that is required for proper texture application.
  - We have a checkbox to toogle displaying the lights
- Scene
  - Our scene represents the Eye of Sauron anf the tower beneath it
  - The scene file can be found [here](scenes/barad-dur.xml)

Here are some screenshots of the scene

## Issues/Problems

- Texture application on the triangle primitive can have strange looking results as exemplified in the [eye view screenshot](screenshots/eyeView.png)
